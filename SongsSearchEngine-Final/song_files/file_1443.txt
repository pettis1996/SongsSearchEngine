I'll Be Home For Christmas
I'll be home for Christmas  
You can plan on me  
Please have snow and mistletoe  
And presents on the tree  
  
Christmas Eve will find me  
Where the love light gleams  
I'll be home for Christmas  
If only in my dreams  
  
I'll be home for Christmas  
You can plan on me  
Please have snow and mistletoe  
And presents on the tree  
  
Christmas Eve'll find me  
Where the love light gleams  
I'll be home for Christmas  
If only in my dreams
