How Great Our Joy
While by the sheep we watched at night  
Glad tidings brought an angel bright  
How great our joy  
(Great our joy)  
Joy, joy, joy  
(Joy, joy, joy)  
Praise we the Lord in Heaven on high  
This gift of God we cherish well  
(That ever by our hearts shall fill)  
How great our joy  
(Great our joy)  
Joy, joy, joy  
(Joy, joy, joy)  
Praise we the Lord in Heaven on high  
Praise we the Lord in Heaven on high
